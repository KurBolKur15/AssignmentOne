							<p>My name is Kur Bol Kur, I have no previous experience or knowledge in Information technology. My nationality is South Sudanese. I do not have any higher education degrees, so to date my education level is equivalent to year 10. My native language is Thuɔŋjäŋ; which is more commonly known as Dinka, I can also speak Arabic and English. One fact about me that others may find interesting could be that I have experience in various farming industries, such as agriculture, horticulture and viticulture and that I previously had my own hobby farm with sheep, goats, pigs, cows, poultry and I had grown fodder, fruit and vegetables.</p>

								<h2>My Interest into Information Technology</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I have had interest in I.T for some time and I am interested in all areas of it. I do not think there was a specific event that gave me interest in this, but I think that understanding the importance and uses of Information technology has given me more interest. I do not have any previous experience in information technology, and I am looking forward to learning all the new concepts and components. I chose to study with RMIT through Open Universities Australia as it is more convenient for me to able to study online as I am also employed at the same time. I am expecting to finish my studies with a completion of a Bachelor of Information Technology and successfully secure a position within the Information Technology sector.</p>

							</p>
							<p>After conducting the Myers-Briggs test it pointed out that I was a protagonist, meaning that I am a great leader, a great team player, and helpful.I think that based on the results that it may influence my behaviour in a team, as I am not afraid to speak my mind, to clarify any uncertainties and I can work well with others and I can provide assistance when required.I think that these results will assist me in being able to join teams with others who have the same personalities, which will help in the team’s successfulness and productivity. Results are Below:</p>

							<li>
							<div style="text-align:left">69% Extraverted</div>

							</p>
							<p>According to the Big Five personality results of this test, Conscientiousness is my strongest point being at 95 percentile score and Intellect and Imagination is my weakest points being at the 65-score percentile.I think that these results mean that I am a good team member that is conscientious, has emotional stability, is agreeable when required.I think that when forming a team that I should take into account others possible members personalities to see if we have similar personalities which would help to make our team more productive and work better together as we have similar behaviours. </p>

							</p>
							<p>After conducting the Test my creativity test the score's of this test my score is 64.76 and the average score is 63.04, which means my score is just above the average score.I think that these results will influence my behaviour in a team as my complexity, which is my ability to carry large quantities of information and the ability to manipulate and manage that information, and also as my curiosity, which the desire to makes changes or improvements would help me in working in a team of likeminded people.I think that when forming a team that I should take into account other people’s traits to see if we are similar, because if we are similar than we should be able to work better together than if we were to work with others who have different behaviours to us.</p>

							<p>Finally, I conducted the Online Learning Style Test. The test told me that I was an Auditory Learner. Meaning that I understand and remember things I have heard, i usually store information by the way it sounds (I learn things easier Auditorily rather than visually), and i have an easier time listening to instructions rather than reading instructions. Results are Below:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>
							<div style="text-align:left">Auditory: 50% </div>

							<h2>Project</h2>
						</header>
							<p>For my project idea I have decided to create a chicken farm simulator. Due to me not having any experience in Information Technology I thought that an easier option would be for me to create a game, as it may not be as complex as some of the other project streams. It will be a game which will simulate the environment of a commercial chicken farm that is farmed within sheds. It will be based on a real-life farming environment to make it seem more realistic and enjoyable for the gamer and it will also give the gamer insight into how chickens are farmed.</p>
							<p>My motivation for creating a chicken farm simulator game, is due to currently being employed within a large commercial chicken farm. I think that a chicken farm simulator game will be interesting for gamers to learn about what is involved in farming chickens and so they can understand how they function and also have an understanding about what processes needs to be taken to produce chickens and eggs for human consumption. I think that a lot of people do not fully understand how a chicken farm is run and how it functions successfully, so this simulator will give them insight into this.</p>
							<p>This chicken farm simulator game will be based within a chicken farming shed. The aim of the game is to walk the shed (which is called floor walking), which will be at full capacity and collect as many eggs as possible, within a certain time frame. The gamer must use a scarer, to scare the birds nesting on the floor and to encourage the hens to lay their eggs in the nesting boxes not on the floor, as eggs laid on the floor have less value then the ones laid in the nest boxes. If the chickens produce more than 1000 eggs that the gamer has not collected them then it will be game over. For each egg collected one point will be earned. All points can be used to go towards purchasing new parts, components and machinery to create a new chicken shed. Each part will be worth different amounts of points. When a certain amount of points is earned within the designated time frame the gamer will be able to receive double the amount of points per egg collected. With each additional shed that the gamer has created they will automatically receive a certain amount of bonus points, which can be used to upgrade the shed, technology and to purchase egg scoops, which will aid the gamer to collect eggs at a faster rate and collect more points. During floor walking and egg collection gamers will be faced with issues that are based on real life scenarios, such as being attacked by roosters, hens that do not want to co-operate and do not allow you to collect the eggs, the scarer not scaring the birds out of the way or making them move to ease the collection of the eggs, machinery break down and times when their will be excessive amounts of eggs to collect. In this game there will be three modes, which will be easy, normal and hard. Each game mode the gamer will be faced with the same scenarios but be faced with different difficulty levels.</p>
							<p>Depending on which app I end up choosing to create this chicken farm simulator game, I will either use the BuildBox app (Welcome to Buildbox, 2021), or the BitDegree app (BitDegree - Revolutionizing education with blockchain, 2021). These seem like suitable apps to create this simulator. There may be other suitable apps to use but these two are the only ones I have found so far as when I have conducted searches for game simulator creators it generally comes with simulator games to play, not to create.</p>
							<p>As I do not have any experience or a lot of knowledge in Information technology then all tasks are new to me, which means that I will need to learn a lot of new skills. I will also need to undertake some online training or watch some YouTube videos to gain the skills required. I could also use the game making app or app to gain information and skills with their step by step guidance and tutorials when creating the game or during the process of making the game.</p>
							<p>I think that the outcome of this chicken farm simulator game is that it will be a successful game. Those people who have interest in farming or poultry will be able to experience real life scenarios and gain an understanding of what it is like working in a chicken farming environment. I think that this type of simulator will also be a popular game as it will give the gamer the opportunity to have a realistic experience of how the processes of farming chickens in sheds is done. I think that this simulator will also assist the future development of different technologies and the farming of chickens within sheds whether it be small or large-scale farming.</p>
